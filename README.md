# Introduction

The current project aims to create a robot that can be controlled using various algorithms, starting from certain available models. The robot is powered by two DC motors, and the algorithms are numerically implemented on an Arduino development board with an embedded microcontroller. The possible algorithms to be selected are as follows:


* Algorithm for obstacle detection and avoidance, through which the robot will be capable of navigating autonomously through its surrounding environment.
* Algorithm for tracking a trajectory represented by a black line.
* Algorithm that allows the robot to reach from one point to another.
* Algorithm for solving a maze. This algorithm is an extension of the trajectory tracking algorithm.
* Algorithm for voice control.
